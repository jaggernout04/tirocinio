Please Note:
-----------
This is a demo version of the scripts & sample project for using the SMPL model's shape-blendshapes & corrective pose-blendshapes inside Unity. We would be happy to receive comments, help and suggestions on improving the model and in making it available on more platforms. 


System Requirements
-------------------
The Unity scripts have been tested in Unity 5+ on Windows 7+10 and MacOS Sierra

Minimum requirement for the SMPL_Mecanim project: 
- Unity 5.6.0f3
- OS: Windows/Mac/Linux

Using the C# Scripts:
--------------------
The C# scripts provided here can be used to load and animate SMPL caharacters in your own project. A step-by-step guide on how to set up the SMPL model inside Unity for your own project is provided in the How-to_SMPLinUnity.pdf file.


About the Sample Project:
------------------------
The sample project is provided to help you get started with SMPL in Unity. The project already contains the SMPL models and sample files. The sample project can be run as is and it shows the ability to use the SMPL male & female characters in a game engine and move them around using keypad controllers. For detailed instructions on how to run the project on your own machine, please consult the included How-to PDF file.
